Dr. Mosca started off his talk by explaining how modern physics came to be, and how one of its consequences is the field of quantum computing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<button data-toggle="modal" data-target="#HerModal" class="btn btn-primary" style="background-color:green">Read More.. </button></p>

<h4 class="modal-title" >Quantum Computing</h4>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
The paradigm shift was initiated when the results of experiments couldn’t be explained by theories and a physical model set up at that time. Some of these phenomenon included Photoelectric Effect, Discrete Spectrum of Atomic Radiation, Stability of atoms, Polarization of light etc. The onset of the Quantum Theory explained several of these phenomenon. But it also brought along with it much more. 
<p>It was much unlike classical physics and failed intuition to a great extent. Dr. Mosca demonstrated this with a fairly simple example of Quantum Interference. A compounded beam splitter, which would normally be expected to give a 50% reading on both the receivers, in fact, gives a 100% reading in one. This result can’t be obtained by a normal probabilistic treatment. The concept of probability amplitudes, which can have complex phase factors (negative probability) needs to be applied.
The Quantum Paradigm had implications that made people, including its founders, uncomfortable. However, it is now the dominant paradigm for physics. Alan Aspect, provided the first experimental verification of the Quantum Theory which contradicted the classical “local hidden variables” theories.</p>

<p>A Quantum Computer is similar to an ordinary one, with the difference being in the implementation of a bit. A Quantum bit (or Qubit) exists as a Linear Combination of All possible states of that bit. Therefore, for simulating n Qubits, one needs to keep track of 2n quantum amplitudes. Qubits are currently being experimented on by trapping ions (also, another technique using Rydberg atoms) which seems to be the path forward. Performance of Superconducting Circuits has shown significant improvement over the years.
Quantum Computers could potentially be used to simulate quantum mechanical systems, counting and optimization, previously intractable mathematical problems (some cases underlying modern cryptography) etc. Peter Shor showed that main key establishment protocols would be broken down by a quantum computer. This calls for a new “quantum-safe” cryptographic infrastructure. This type of cryptography can achieve security on the cloud as well. Dr. Mosca believes that the current infrastructure is susceptible and that the need for this solution is imminent.</p>
<p>He elaborated on the 7 fundamental stages of Quantum Information Processing. Developing logical Qubits with longer lifetime than physical Qubits is where current research is focused on. He also, approximates that a fault-tolerant system will developed within the next five years, after which, building a useful and reliable quantum computer will be within our reach.</p>

<p>There are other sides to the larger solution as well, can the new quantum-safe cryptographic solution be integrated with the existing infrastructure? Are the current standards, practices and computational paradigms feasible for a new quantum one? These are the questions that will be answered as the future unfolds. A Quantum Computer may still be a long way down the road, but the destination is not unclear as it was a few years ago.</p>

<p>What are the secrets of the success of Silicon Valley? It accounted for about 12% of all new U.S. patents and 50% of all new patents coming from California in 2009. Silicon Valley per-capita income is much higher than U.S. and California averages. But so is the cost of living. How can Silicon Valley sustain such a high cost of living? Silicon Valley thrives via an innovation-based entrepreneurial economy. It is a robust engine for new company creation. Necessary elements of an innovation-based, entrepreneurial economy are dynamic coming together of people, ideas, capital, and infrastructure. Well-known characteristics of Silicon Valley are results-oriented and risk-taking social values, highly educated and mobile workforce, R&D activities in many technology areas, concentration of venture investors, fascination with, and flexibility to reinvent itself around “the next new thing”, strong supporting human infrastructure (lawyers, accountants, technology and marketing consultants, executive search firms, etc.), and last but most importantly a very strong industry friendly Stanford University. Stanford did not create Silicon Valley but has been an important part of the system. Stanford’s relationships with industry encourage innovation for real products, collaboration on pre-competitive technology and human networking. The evolution of the Silicon Valley system shows importance of young people and importance of existing companies allowing a fluid labor market and doing business with start-up companies. This talk focused on these aspects of Silicon Valley as well as resulting innovations.</p>

  A highly qualified civil servant, Dr. Ranjan has been closely associated with BITS Pilani. He presented his last lecture in a unique manner, by narrating the stories of four of his colleagues in the IAS, who were incidentally from BITS Pilani. The ideas enshrined in his tales were diverse. He spoke about people who had achieved all the success in life, yet ended up with a broken family. Another incident was of a person who went the wrong way in life,  but certain incidents corrected him and now he is quite successful. His frank manner, was extremely endearing, and his anecdotes earned him a lot of applause from the audience.

A graduate of the Film and Televison Institute of India (FTTI), she was also a top student at school. Specialising in genetics, she spoke about how she received her acceptance letter from the FTTI, on the day before her departure to the US for her higher studies. She emphasised the importance of faliures in ever success. She also mentioned the hardships of film-making, about the enormous amount of multitasking required. At the end of the speech, one question was on everyone’s mind, for her “How do I become a filmmaker?”

Ranjan began on a light note, stating Hollywood was mere 6 miles from USC. We can expect him to have lots of fun out there. He outlined the procedure to apply, pointing amount of course work, possible research done and opportunities. 
    <p>He stressed on the importance of having a strong profile.  We have loads of engineers in our country with similar profile and most don’t get what they want. What separates them? English. We need to express ourselves properly and present in an appropriate manner. </p>
<p>Switching to ground work, Ranjan stated the importance of approaching professors and trying to get projects towards the end of 2-2. He made us aware of PS being different from a project. He was fortunate to get a PS at IGCAR, Kalpakam, but his project was completely different from what he is to do at VITERBI. Ranjan marked 3-1 as the time of introspection. He stated the importance of knowing what we are doing. Try to think about projects and if possible make bold research statements, etc.</p>
   <p> Coming back to VITERBI, he prophesied the necessity of being honest and writing well. Only 20 students are selected from India and that too mostly from IITs. Very few are lucky to have a strong profile as Sanjana, a 9.7 pointer. So, we need to give our best shot and convince our professor about contributing in his work. Coming to professors, he said it is extremely important to do a background check on the professors and look for those working in your field of interest.</p>
<p>Adding to Ranjan’s thoughts, Sanjana recalled the importance of good project in PS and necessity of recommendations from project guides.</p>
<p>Next up we moved to another part of U.S., Atlanta, Georgia. RajatSaxena made us proud by securing a summer internship out there. He also has a project in hand at the Washington University. Rajat seemed to have an instant connect with the audience, partly due to his CG. There was a huge applause when he mentioned his CG was less than 8.5 and 7.47 to be precise.</p>
<p>Sharing his modus operandi, he recalled sending mails to professors of his liking in prestigious universities like Ohio, Georgia, etc.  He gave an important tip of not attaching your CV as prof. might regard it as spam. Rather, we might give a Google link to our profile.</p>
    <p>In his address to 2nd year students, he said this is time for self-realisation. Similar to Ranjan, he stated on the importance of choosing what is best for you, GRE, CAT, GMAT, etc. Also, one shouldn’t wait for projects, rather try open source or informal projects. First, find your interests and start learning about it as there is no end to learning.</p>

He initially started off stating that one piece of advice he would give to all the students present is to do do well in academics. He elaborated further saying that by doing well, he meant for us to learn to apply a cincept in class, for which one had to understand the theory and think beyond. He mentioned that getting an A is not as crucial as application of a concept is. Also, it is easy to like or dislike a course, however, he urged students to be receptive and look for what a course is trying to convey, understand what happens in its domain.by doing the same for various domanins, we would develop what he mentioned to be a multi-disciplinary approach towards a concept. He said that by cultivationg such an approach, a problem in one domain could be solved easily by adopting certain problem solving mechanisms from other domains. He also advised students to be wise with our choice of electives, choose one that would stimulate them and arouse their interest. He urged students to explore as much as possible and to never restrict themselves to anything. 
<p>On a final note, he told us to keep in mind that one's fields for pursuing Ph.D narrow down after working for a long time in a particular field and that work experience is not a certain requiremnt but would help in their Masters. He wrapped up the session wishing the students all the best for their higher studies and asking them to explore and work their way through.</p>

Astrodynamics, a highly upcoming specialisation in Aerospace Engineering, is simply the study of motion of objects in space. It is basically an application of Classical Mechanics. Astrodynamics is very important in applications such as launching rockets, and satellites into space. Mr. Kumar, them went further, and explained that it mainly consisted of Classical Mechanics and was used to find the trajectory of objects in space. He then described the various important missions, such as Curiosity, Kepler and explained the role of Astrodynamics, in deciding the precise details of their launch and delivery into orbit. He also spoke about its application in GPS satellites, measuring earth’s magnetic field and other projects. He also highlighted remote sensing, and spoke about how his colleagues worked upon processing the data they received from the Japanese Tsunami.
<p>After an initial discussion about the subject, he then went on to describe the projects he worked upon. These were very interesting and diverse, such as designing a satellite, the Infrared Interferometry Satellite and a project about Weak Stability. He described various other ideas, such as designing a mission so as to send a probe to an asteroid and return with samples.  He then went on to speak about one of his main projects, regarding the dynamics of the Mu ring of Uranus and its satellite Mab. Among the things an Astrodynamicist does is identifying risk factors and analysing missions for risks and feasibility studies.</p>
<p>He then went on to speak about the future of the Space industry, which he said was in commercialisation and privatisation of space. The illustrated this by highlighting SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. After this, CubeSats, miniature satellites were discussed, and he urged students to take part in such projects.</p>
<p>He then went on to describe the required background for a career in Astrodynamics. He said that a person needs experience in the hands on aspects of engineering. Expertise in mathematics is required, with knowledge of statics and dynamics.</p>
<p>The speaker concluded the talk and recommended students to consider coming to TU Delft for their higher studies. The talk was a great success and it helped students get familiar with the field of Astrodynamics.</p>

  He started off by stressing the importance of innovation, and specified four criteria for successful innovation; creative leadership, team building, creative climate/ environment and resources. He cited examples from his past experiences in AT&T / Muffatlal to put forth his point. All in all, he wanted us to  have an open mind about our abilities and use collaboration and proper direction as tools for successful innovations. His talk was all about making us realise that innovation is the key to realising one's dream. An innovative approach is crucial for the success of a person's dream.

  He urged us to live our lives outside the box, cut out of the confinements, stop living by set patterns rigidly. He recounted his experience when he shifted gears from Chemical engineering to a career in writing, facing the unfamiliar, striving for success and coming out with flying colours. He hoped we would be able to broaden our horizon as well, dream big, importantly struggle to achieve it. To drive home his point that one should always be receptive to everything and not limit themselves, he talked about his experimentation with holography, coming up with 3D holography patents, employing 1500 people, propelling Mr. Narendra Modi's campaign and outreach immensely in Gujarat, something he had never anticipated in his youth. He(can we use short sentences :P) asked us not to define ourselves as it ultimately means confining our infinite spirit into the tiny crucible, we call ourselves. Mr Shankar stressed on following one’s dream, mainstream or otherwise and making a success story out of it.

  He compared research with a painting, saying that a researcher alone can decide when his research is complete, just as a painter would know when his masterpiece is done. He also mentioned research leads to innovation and entrepreneurship leads the innovation forward. He talked about his experience with computers and shared how he discovered his passion, and also highlighted his  academic goals and their realization.

 Dr. Ram, the director of Apollo Institue for blood pressure management and Texas blood pressure institute, talked about pursuit of excellence in daily life and advised us to put in our best efforts, irrespective of the situation, and not to go too much off focus from our goals. He abbreviated FEAR as False Evidence Appearing Real, and disclosed that there is no such phrase as 'for better or for worse’; it always is 'for better and for better'. On a final note, he stated that greatness can be thrust; however, excellence can only be achieved by commitment.
So, all in all, the Conclave was a fun filled, informative, and deeply motivating session, which urged us to open our wings wide open and soar high.

Extra-curricular activities
<p>Extracurricular activities play a major role in being selected for the YLP. You need to mention something that is significant and makes you stand apart from other candidates. This includes organising fests, being part of social initiatives etc.</p>
Academics
<p>Academics also play a major role. Your CGPA should be 8+, to be on the safer side. This also includes any projects you have done, papers published.</p>
<p>#Tip 1: The ISB, despite being a management institute, looks forward for academic achievements, because unlike the IIMs, the ISB has a 10 month programme with high rigour. Academic success shows that you can handle it.</p>
Achievements
<p>Technical papers, projects, awards all count as plus points, regardless of their field, be it social, academic, activities at national and international levels, etc.
#Tip 2: If you have a low GPA, you must have a strong enough reason to show them, e.g.:  extra-curricular activities, etc.
Video</p>

<p>This is the most unique feature of the ISB process. Basically, the purpose of the video is to see what sets you apart from other candidates. You have a chance to project yourselves the way, you wish to be seen. Tell them about yourselves, why you want to join, what makes you special, etc.</p>
<p>#Tip 3: Do not repeat what you have already said in your resume.</p>
Round 2
August - Final year
<p>The GMAT score is taken into consideration for the YLP. A score > 650 is considered good. A score more than 700 is required to compensate for a low CGPA.
Two letters of recommendation are required. These could be from anyone, Professors, supervisors of internships etc.
#Tip 4: Instead of getting a LOR from a person who is at a high post, better take it from a person who knows you better. There are better chances of being selected if the letters are more personalised and the person knows about you.</p>
Round 3
Personal interview (on Campus)
September - Final year
<p>The interview is designed to be a stress interview. Quoting the speaker, there were some very interesting ways used by the interviewers to stress out the candidates.
It is seen if the achievements listed by the candidate live up to what he is. Every minute detail is prodded to check its authenticity.</p>
<p>#Tip 5: Be prepared with WHATEVER you have written in your resume.</p>
<p>You will need to be prepared with your short term (in your two year period before the PGP) and long term goals (how do you intend to use your degree after the PGP). Also, you need to show them what you have done with your interests.</p>
<p>You should be clear about how you expect ISB will help you and you need to project how BITS helped you in becoming what you are.
Project your basic skill set which you have honed during your college days, such as managerial, entrepreneurial, leadership, etc.</p> 
<p>#Tip 6: Think of yourself as a brand, and project yourself to the panel.</p>
<p>Be as clear and precise as possible. Remember, it’s among the best B-schools in India. And be honest about your weaknesses.</p>

  Her unique accomplishments have been documented in more than a dozen featured articles and in 2008, Howard received worldwide attention for her SnoMote robots, designed to study the impact of global warming on the Antartic ice shelfs. Coming to her research work, Howard describes it as "centered around the concept of humanized intelligence, the process of embedding the human cognitive capability into the control path of autonomous systems". Howard was gracious enough to make a visit to our college BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus during the pre-Atmos lecture series and provide us with an enriching experience and insight into her field of research on the humanized intelligence of robots.

 Dr. Wolcott has drawn a strategic plan on how to build entrepreneurial capabilities. He delivered a lecture on the seven to climbing the chair (  ). His first, always keep in mind the MISSION Focus – Are we focused on the right thing & Clarity – Does everyone understand. * Innovation is not about Chance so try figuring out your challenges and come up with the best possible solution to overcome. *Try viewing things from a different perspective, by living in multiple worlds as a service provider as well as a seeker. *As we know the essence of innovation management is resolving uncertainty through a rational process. Innovation strategy is building and diversifying a portfolio to reduce the uncertainty. * Seek wisdom in mistakes esp. the unexpected ones. *Try to know yourself and explore the hidden one - in you an executor to carry out the plan or an entrepreneur with a vision to change the future or whether you can take up the role of a pessimist or an optimist as we need both around the table. And finally he concluded his speech by adding on some invest management tips.

 <p>Its  truely said "Eventually with GUIDANCE all the pieces fit".Students aspiring for higher studies leave no stone unturned during their undergraduate years to make themselves competent enough for seats in the best universities around the world especially the top oes like MIT,Caltech,Cornell to name a few. And thus to help students explore and chose better BITSAA (alumni association of BITS) initiated  BITS2MSPhD  an initiative for BITSians, who are interested in pursuing Masters and Doctoral programs from worlds leading universities. This initiative aims to connect prospective students with BITSians who are attending/have attended the world's top graduate programs. This 4000+ strong group is India's largest such endeavor. They reach out to students on all four BITS campuses through BITS-Embryo and conduct various interactive sessions throughout the year providing guidance on universities' programs and research,Funding/financing related information ,GRE and TOEFL preparation and inputs on preparing Resume and Statement of Purpose.Basically BITS2MSPhD does for students what google maps does for a person who knows his destination but not the paths leading there.</p>

<p>During one of such sessions called Know Your University Andrea Colaco alumni of BITS-Pilani Campus who completed her Masters and PhD at MIT and is currently working in highly reputed MIT Media Labs highlighted the importance of a strong overall profile .She made a crystal clear point that just high GRE scores and high CGPA are not enough,you need to do things that are out of the box.We also had an excellent opportunity of interacting with PhD students Pahar Mitra (Harvard University) and Ajay Bhatt(Cornell University) who enlighted us with research work and opportunities at their universities.The guidance session by Varsha Rajshekar on Application Procedures for MS and PhD was very informative and useful for all aspirants.</p>

<h4 class="modal-title" >Importance of Leadership in today’s India</h4>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
 Dr. Bedi focused on the role leadership plays in our daily life, spoke about what distinguishes a leader from the crowd. She started off stating that 'conscience' is the keyword in anything to do with leadership. One has to learn to identify one's inner voice, listen to it in order to make the right decision in complex scenarios. The abilities to make the right decision and see to its execution are the trademark characteristics of leaders. However, to evolve as a good leader, the conflict involved in decision making, conflicting for the right things in life, has to start at an early age. To enhance this ability, one has to keep formulating ideas and engage in a self debate constantly, so as to develop a sense of direction. Eventually the capacity to make the right choice would turn instinctive. When questioned about the ethical value of the means followed to reach to a right end, she replied saying that the end doesn't always justify the means. One has to stay honest and committed to his morals, principles, and compromising on them would defeat the very purpose of the justified end. All in all, the talk was very thought provoking and inspired many to engage in constant reevaluation of one's thoughts and beliefs.
<h5>Quotes:</h5>
</p>I wake up every morning</p>
to a new day</p>
but the same old misery,</p>
<p>I see the chains binding us for centuries are still holding tight,</p> 
<p>with each passing day they pull us deeper into their embrace </p>
<p>67 years is a long time to wait for them to snap </p>
<p>Its time we put up a struggle and let out the fire in our hearts</p> 
<p>for change is one BIG word </p>
<p>but it must start with us !!</p>
