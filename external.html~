 <p> Dr. Mosca started off his talk by explaining how modern physics came to be, and how one of its consequences is the field of quantum computing. A Quantum Computer is similar to an ordinary one, with the difference being in the implementation of a bit. A Quantum Computer may still be a long way down the road, but the destination is not unclear as it was a few years ago.

  A highly qualified civil servant, Dr. Ranjan has been closely associated with BITS Pilani. He presented his last lecture in a unique manner, by narrating the stories of four of his colleagues in the IAS, who were incidentally from BITS Pilani. The ideas enshrined in his tales were diverse. He spoke about people who had achieved all the success in life, yet ended up with a broken family. Another incident was of a person who went the wrong way in life,  but certain incidents corrected him and now he is quite successful. His frank manner, was extremely endearing, and his anecdotes earned him a lot of applause from the audience.

<div class="modal-body">
Ranjan began on a light note, stating Hollywood was mere 6 miles from USC. We can expect him to have lots of fun out there. He outlined the procedure to apply, pointing amount of course work, possible research done and opportunities. 
    <p>He stressed on the importance of having a strong profile.  We have loads of engineers in our country with similar profile and most don’t get what they want. What separates them? English. We need to express ourselves properly and present in an appropriate manner. </p>
<p>Switching to ground work, Ranjan stated the importance of approaching professors and trying to get projects towards the end of 2-2. He made us aware of PS being different from a project. He was fortunate to get a PS at IGCAR, Kalpakam, but his project was completely different from what he is to do at VITERBI. Ranjan marked 3-1 as the time of introspection. He stated the importance of knowing what we are doing. Try to think about projects and if possible make bold research statements, etc.</p>
   <p> Coming back to VITERBI, he prophesied the necessity of being honest and writing well. Only 20 students are selected from India and that too mostly from IITs. Very few are lucky to have a strong profile as Sanjana, a 9.7 pointer. So, we need to give our best shot and convince our professor about contributing in his work. Coming to professors, he said it is extremely important to do a background check on the professors and look for those working in your field of interest.</p>
<p>Adding to Ranjan’s thoughts, Sanjana recalled the importance of good project in PS and necessity of recommendations from project guides.</p>
<p>Next up we moved to another part of U.S., Atlanta, Georgia. RajatSaxena made us proud by securing a summer internship out there. He also has a project in hand at the Washington University. Rajat seemed to have an instant connect with the audience, partly due to his CG. There was a huge applause when he mentioned his CG was less than 8.5 and 7.47 to be precise.</p>
<p>Sharing his modus operandi, he recalled sending mails to professors of his liking in prestigious universities like Ohio, Georgia, etc.  He gave an important tip of not attaching your CV as prof. might regard it as spam. Rather, we might give a Google link to our profile.</p>
    <p>In his address to 2nd year students, he said this is time for self-realisation.
